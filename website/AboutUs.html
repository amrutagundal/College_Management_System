                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Foundation And Establishment</h2>
                <p class="center">In 1995, The Government offered technical assistance in establishing an institute of higher education in engineering in India. 
				
The Institute was formally inaugurated in 1996 by Prof. Andrew, Union Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs. 

The Blossom's Group of Education has  three Institutes of Technology. The first of these to be instituted are at  Mumbai (estb. 1996), Chennai (estb. 1997), Pune (estb. 1998).

The Institute has sixteen academic departments and several advanced research centres in various disciplines of engineering and pure sciences. 

A faculty of international repute, a brilliant student community, excellent technical & supporting staff and an effective administration have all contributed to the pre-eminent status of Blossom's group of Education. 

The campus is located in the city of Mumbai. 


Blossom's Group of Education is well-equipped to provide an online degree course.

 We have been ranked number 1 Engineering Group of Institute for the past 5 years and we have been ranked number 1 Overall for the past 2 years by NIRF.</p>
            
			<h2 class="h-secondary center">Vision and Goal</h2>
			<p class="center">Blossom's Group of Education wishes to reach out to the many aspiring and motivated learners across India.
			
			An online degree is the perfect way to accomplish this, as it is not limited by on-campus physical infrastructure.


      Being an online program, we can accommodate between 50,000 to a lakh learners per batch.


It is a game changer as working professionals, and learners of any age group can enroll in it.


Students currently enrolled in a physical college in any program can join here and earn their second degree. 

(University Grants Commission had announced in 2020 that students will now be permitted to pursue two degree programs simultaneously if one is in online mode)
Since there are no restrictions on the base subjects, students from other streams such as commerce / arts / law and of course, science students can enroll in this program.

 We plan to bring in more personalised mentors to help students with Diploma Level and Degree Level courses.


In future, we are considering tie-ups with industries to enable internships and project opportunities. 

This will also facilitate hiring of our learners who perform well in the program.</p></div>
